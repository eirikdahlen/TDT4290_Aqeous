## Commit message format

Types = {feat, docs, bugfix, test, refactor, chore, style}

Example of commit:
`#5 style: add style to component x`

## Branching

Every issue needs a seperate branch. All branching is done from the "master"-branch, and merged into the "master"-branch.

When an issue is finished, a pull request must be opened and receive at least one code review.
